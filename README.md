# NL-BUCKLING
In this repository I'm going to share the Ansys Mechanical APDL code that I've used to perform non linear buckling analysis for my degree's final thesis

# How to use it?
You only have to start Ansys Mechanical APDL Launcher and set the NL-BUCKLING folder as the working directory. For the jobname you can use initially an arbitriary name but then it's going to be changed depending on the analysis.
After that you go to File -> Read Input From -> scripts -> main_tfg.txt

# How to edit it?
I recommend doing it in VS Code. Open Folder -> NL-BUCKLING
