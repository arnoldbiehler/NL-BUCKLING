# NL-BUCKLING

In this repository, I'm sharing the Ansys Mechanical APDL code that I've used to perform nonlinear buckling analysis for my degree's final thesis.

## What is Nonlinear Buckling?
Nonlinear buckling is a critical phenomenon in structural engineering where structures can collapse under certain loads. Understanding and predicting buckling behavior is essential for ensuring the safety and stability of engineering designs.

## How to use it?

1. Start the Ansys Mechanical APDL Product Launcher.
2. Set the `NL-BUCKLING` folder as the working directory.
3. For the `jobname`, initially use an arbitrary name. This name will be changed depending on the analysis.
4. Go to `File -> Read Input From -> scripts -> main_tfg.txt`.

## How to edit it?

I recommend using VS Code to edit the code.

1. Open VS Code.
2. Select `Open Folder` and choose the `NL-BUCKLING` folder.
3. Go to `scripts` and open `main_tfg.txt`. In this file, you can edit all relevant parameters of the simulation.
4. Save the changes and go back to ANSYS to run the analysis with the new settings.
